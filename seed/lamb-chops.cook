Light the barbecue and let it get nice and hot. Make sure
the bars of the barbecue are clean and free from any burnt
on residue.

Take the @lamb chops{8%large} out of the fridge and place on
a plate to come up to room temperature. Meanwhile...

Peel the @garlic{2%cloves}. Bash the @fennel seeds{1%tsp} in
a pestle and mortar until fine.

Pick and add the leaves from @fresh oregano{2%sprigs}, the garlic,
@extra virgin olive oil{1%splash} and @salt{pinch} and bash again.

Stir in the @ground cinnamon{pinch}, zest the @lemon over the top
and mix again. Tip into a roasting tray and spread out.

Lightly splash the fat in several places along the chops.

Place the chops in one layer on a board, season well with @salt and
@black pepper{} then bash and flatten slightly with the base of
a small saucepan.

Transfer the chops to the roasting tray, then turn over in the
marinade to coat, then leave to marinate for around ~{30%minutes}.

When the bars of the grill are nice and hot, drop the chops onto
the hot side and sear on both sides for 2 minutes, or until browned
all over (move the chops away from any flames that appear).

Cut the lemon in half with a clean knife, and squeeze over
the chops for the last minute of cooking, then transfer to
a plate to rest before serving.
